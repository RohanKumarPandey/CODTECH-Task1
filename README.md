Overview of Project:  ![Screenshot 2024-10-02 151327](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4acfeb77-8fa2-41c9-b87b-ea365b78a499)


Project: C++ Temperature Converter 



A temperature converter project in C++ typically allows the user to convert temperatures between different scales, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It serves as a beginner-level project to demonstrate basic programming concepts, such as input/output operations, conditional statements, and mathematical formulas.

Key Activities:  

User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a temperature value and the scale to which the conversion is desired.Conversion Logic: The program implements formulas to convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.Celsius to Fahrenheit: ( F = \frac{9}{5} \times C + 32 )Fahrenheit to Celsius: ( C = \frac{5}{9} \times (F - 32) )Celsius to Kelvin: ( K = C + 273.15 )Kelvin to Celsius: ( C = K - 273.15 )Display Result: After conversion, the program outputs the result to the user.Error Handling: The program may include checks to ensure the user inputs valid temperature values and selections.

Technology Used:  

Programming Language: C++IDE: Any C++ IDE like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual StudioCompiler: A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or MSVC)

Objective:  

The primary objective of the C++ Temperature Converter project is to:Demonstrate proficiency in basic C++ concepts such as variables, functions, conditionals, and loops.Provide a practical application for mathematical conversions in programming.Improve understanding of user input/output handling and basic error checking.
